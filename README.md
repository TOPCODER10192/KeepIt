# KeepIt ðŸ”‘
KeepIt is a hardware-free item tracking application available on iOS devices. The goal of this app was to create something similar to Tile, without using any special chips or trackers which can be quite expensive

## Note âš 
You may notice that almost all the contributions in this repository are done by "Bree Chelle". This is because I did almost all the development for this application on my sisters MacBook. I was unable to develop the app on my own laptop since it is not an Apple computer (I have a Dell XPS 13). A VM also wasn't a practical solution since my laptop has relatively low computing power.
